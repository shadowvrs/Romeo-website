                    We regret to inform everyone who is a part of the rome squad of
                     this. The sun for sorrow will not show his face, for he is 
                     dead as of last week. He was found dead in the tomb of the 
                     Capulets with his faithful lover Juliet. He took his own life 
                     along with Juliet in a failed plan to avoid Julietâ€™s marriage 
                     to the county Paris. We know that it will be hard for all the 
                     rome squad readers to read this, but we hope you can join us 
                     in mourning the loss of this beloved child of ours. We have 
                     since removed all posts that we deemed to have too much 
                     personal info attached, as we want the most privacy for the 
                     family at this time.

                        We regret to inform everyone who is a part of the Rome squad of
                        this. The sun for sorrow will not show his face, for he is 
                        dead as of last week. He was found dead in the tomb of the 
                        Capulets with his faithful lover Juliet. He took his own life 
                        alongside his love Juliet in a failed plan to avoid Julietâ€™s marriage 
                        to the county Paris. We know that it will be hard for all the 
                        Rome squad readers to read this, but we hope you can join us 
                        in mourning the loss of this beloved child of ours. We have 
                        since removed all posts that we deemed to have too much 
                        personal info attached, as we want the most privacy for the 
                        family at this time. We will also be removing the requirement
                        to login as it is unnecessary.

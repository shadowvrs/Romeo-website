                <p>
                    Today is my 69th blog! We have really come a long way, Rome Squad forever!!!! Today my close friend Benvolio, in hopes of alleviating my recent love pain, promised to try and find me a new love other than Rosaline, but I don’t have much faith in him. I remember the first time I saw her, completely struck by her grace, it was at that moment I knew that she was the love of my life. I will not give up on having a gf, Rosaline deep down must love me right? It’s a crazy world out here in Verona. The people here are really proud, full of energy, sometimes obnoxious, and the eternal feud between my family and the Capulets does not help. Just today my previously mentioned good friend Benvolio had a really extreme fight against Tybalt of the Capulets. Bullet holes were everywhere, but all of you probably saw that on the news :/ . After some time alone and a bit of grieving I will be back on here to talk about more stuff. Rosaline was a total babe and all, but you live and you learn, right? these girls man… I think I am just going to go eat some more ice cream.

                <p>
                    I went to the Capulet’s party today to crash it with the boys. The guards didn’t recognize us as Montagues so we got inside pretty easily. Their family’s house was beautifully decorated, the food was decent I guess (Lie, I am just jealous—My family never had parties like this). This stuff felt like a comedy musical lmao. Benvolio was always a laid back guy (the shooting before does not count - Tybalt’s fault), but I can say I have never seen him like this. Mercutio on the other hand, geez, he was causing all sorts of trouble. Flirting with every girl (and guy), laughing like a madman, screaming, you name it. You could remove every person from there, and it wouldn’t matter, the party will go on. That's Mercutio for you. Rosaline was still closed off to me, and I didn’t feel any better than whatever I was experiencing yesterday. But something turned this dull and dreadful night into the most amazing day of my life. I laid my eyes on the most breathtaking woman I have ever seen. I didn’t know who she was at that time when I first saw her in the bathroom. BTW don’t @ me, I was not a creep going into the girls bathroom, the Capulets are the freaks. Who the hell would have a TRANSPARENT aquarium between the two bathrooms??? Anyway, the place turned quiet, and there was just me and her. This definitely was not the same thing I felt with Rosaline, this time it was different. I was hooked, and after a while of just staring at each other through the mega stupid aquarium, we both met outside. We laughed and danced for what felt like eternity. We even kissed in one of the elevators. Once the elevator doors opened up though, she was called away by a woman. It was only later I realized that it was the nurse of the Capulets. I know, I know “big L Romeo, you're such an unlucky dumbass LOL”. But I was not going to take this, this won’t stop me not one bit. I was already planning on how to find her after this party is over, but it would be really dangerous. So I casually trespassed on Capulet territory right after everyone left, and somehow found her window in their mansion. We had a little heart to heart, and decided right then and there to get married. We didn’t get enough time for the intricacies, but it will work.

                    To start off on a good note, Friar Lawrence agreed to marry me and Juliet earlier today so you know what that means... Your <b><i>boy</i></b> is now married! The service was amazing and it was awesome to see Juliet again. In fact, things were looking great between me and Juliet. Until Juliet's cousin - Tybalt showed up. I think he had a score to settle with me, he just kept talking about how I inflicted immeasurable pain upon him by embarrassing him at a party infront of his friends and family by being way cooler than him (might have made up that last part). Still, I had no idea what he was talking about. He was all up in my face, trying to make me fight him, but again I really didn’t care, after all, he was family now. So I tried to speak to him, explain how all this hate won’t bring any good, but he wouldn’t listen. Next thing I knew, Mercutio stood up for me and fought him. Things got pretty heated, as Mercutio kept mocking Tybalt. I knew this wouldn’t end well so I tried jumping in to stop them both, but Tybalt took this as an opportunity to strike Mercutio with a piece of glass. was fatally wounded. My best friend was lying in my hands on the brink of death, and there was nothing I could do. I was consumed with rage. So I found him and  slew him by my own hand, and while my dearest friend Mercutio died. The Prince was on the scene shortly after, and as you all probably already know, I am banished from Verona forever. I couldn’t believe it. It does not seem like that will change any time soon, but I will be coming back for the sake of Juliet. No matter what.

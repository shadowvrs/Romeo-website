                    Things were looking great between Juliet and me. Friar Lawrence agreed to get us married earlier today, and everything was great. Until Juliet's cousin - Tybalt showed up. He had a score to settle with me (I think). He kept talking about how I inflicted immeasurable pain upon him? He was all up in my face, trying to make me fight him, but I really couldn’t care, after all, he was family now. I tried to speak to him, explain how all this hate won’t bring any good to anyone. I wanted him to be my brother, but it seems the hate has no visible roots, it was deep down, unnecessary, and unreasonable. Next thing I knew, Mercutio stood up for me and fought him, things were getting pretty heated, as he kept mocking Tybalt. I knew this would not end well. After some back and forth beating, Mercutio was fatally wounded. My best friend was lying in my hands on the brink of death, and there was nothing I could do. I was consumed with rage. So I found him and  slew him by my own hand, and while my dearest friend Mercutio died. The Prince was on the scene shortly after, and as you all probably already know, I am banished from Verona forever. I couldn’t believe it. It does not seem like that will change any time soon, but I will be coming back for the sake of Juliet. No matter what.

                <p>
                    Blog update: I still miss Verona, it was the city of my birth 
                    after all. I just hope I don’t die out here, I would much rather 
                    die in the place of my birth. Friar Laurence said it's an 
                    opportunity to see the “broad and wide world”, but I think 
                    there is no world without Verona walls. I miss the people, 
                    the streets, and even the smells. Not only is this my dear 
                    and only city, but Juliet is still stuck in there. I really
                    wish there was some sort of signal here so I could text 
                    Juliet and see how things are doing. Maybe I will work on 
                    that tonight so I can actually send this blog, though I could
                    also do some reflective golfing in the sunset. I could even 
                    take a nice photo with me hitting a hole in one as I look 
                    into the sunset in complete contemplation of the meaning of
                    love and death. Yeah, I think I will do that tonight. Anyway 
                    speaking of Mantua, there is nothing special about this city 
                    or its residents, just a bunch of trailers and a few buildings.
                    I guess I will keep wandering about for now taking cinematic
                    photos of me in the sunset. I wonder what Juliet is doing 
                    right now… Guess I will wait a little to see. Anyway, 
                    <b><i>VERONA SQUAD</i></b> out.
